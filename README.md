# Chess

I aim to have a working knowledge of C++ and Machine Learning
How about building chess from the basic engine to the AI agent that we shall play against?

Goals:
- Play with a friend in the same computer
- Play with a friend in some sort of network
- Play against an engine
- Build an AI agent

Well, chess is awesome and interesting. Understanding how it works will take a low of work but a very welcome work since it is closely related to the area of research that I'm interesting on.

This seems to be the most important reference for now -> https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page

I want to work with information theory and physics, I am very glad that chess, another thing I love, is not only a subject of information theory, but also have been studied but no other the Claude Shannon the father of information theory I heard so much about from Nestor Caticha in my probability classes.

My first goal then is to understand Shannon's work and make an implemention of it. It seems this is going to be my first paper implementation.

A *references* section can be found under /docs/references with important texts such as the Shannon's paper on chess that I'll be starting with.

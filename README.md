# Chess

I aim to have a working knowledge of C++ and Machine Learning
How about building chess from the basic engine to the AI agent that we shall play against?

Goals:
- Play with a friend in the same computer
- Play with a friend in some sort of network
- Play against an engine
- Build an AI agent
